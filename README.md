# pandas-challenge
This is a pandas challenge where the objective is to use pandas and Jupyter Notebook to combine datasets of schools and students. The task is to generate an overview of the merged dataframe for each school, including details such as enrolment size, school type, budget, average scores, and passing percentage. Schools are ranked based on their overall passing percentage, from highest to lowest.
The performance is further analyzed by breaking it down into various metrics and categories, such as budget per student, school size, and the type of school listed in each dataframe.The main goal of correlating and reorganizing the data, along with creating different dataframes, is to provide a comprehensive summary of the dataset and identify key trends through data manipulation.
